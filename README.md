# worst ui competition

The idea behind this challenge is to create the worst UI in the world for a web application. The theme is open-ended, but an example could be a scoring system for judges evaluating athletes in Olympic competitions.

The goal is to draw out as much creativity and technical knowledge as possible to create something unconventional and funny. There are no restrictions on the technology used, but we recommend frameworks like React or Vue, which greatly facilitate the creation of web applications.

Although the idea is to build the worst UI, it doesnâ€™t necessarily have to be visually unappealing. Therefore, we suggest using a styling framework like Tailwind. Below are some useful links, including the documentation for the frameworks and a video with examples of applications with terrible UIs.
